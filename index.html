						<p>I have been in the IT field for 10+ years. Started out as a trading software support along with desktop support. Eventually I did work with servers and have touch some networking. At one company, I was a jack of all tech at a smaller company. I eventually switch over to a bigger where I primary do desktop support.</p>

						<p>During this time, I have always been interested with programming. I remember in high school where it all started. I took a Visual Basic class and I enjoyed it. However, I was distracted playing basketball and other teenager things.</p>

						<p>Now that I'm out of school I have been more interested in learning. While in school as a student you feel the need to do whatever you need to do to just pass a course and get the piece of paper at the end. The saying "the youth is wasted on the young" have never seem to be truer than it does now. Now I'm more interested in learning and having a job that I love. I do have a family and twins. So now any free time I have I have to devote to satisfying my hunger to learn.</p>

						<p>Some of the things that I enjoy doing is cooking. I enjoy grilling food and smoking meat. I find joy watching people enjoying the food that I created. I also like watching movies. My free time now is limited but once my boys grow up a little bit then I'll be able to have them enjoy some of things I enjoy. At least I hope they will enjoy some of the things that I enjoy.</p>
